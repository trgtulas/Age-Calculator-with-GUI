# Age-Calculator-with-GUI
A basic age calculator that I wrote for trying my first knowledges with Python--
There are some problem with the program. The program assumes that all months have 30 days. We can fix this problem with a basic dictionary method. We can assign to each months variables that how many days have for each of them in a dictionary. After that, we call the months variable for calculating the age.
Other Problem is leap year :).
